# heart-rate-prediction


here we are predicting heart disease based on the data which was taken from the small hospital in which therpatients' age,cholesterolestrol level, blood pressure level, etc. There are of total 1026 patients and we have 14 rows. all the data are gathered in the table.

we are using machine learning models to predict the person is having a heart disease or not and we are showing which variables affecting the on the heart diseases and also check with the confusion matrix and the model accuracy and precision.

Here we are using logistic regression to build the model so that the prediction can be done easily. we are using logistic regression. logistic regression is used when we have the categorical variables as yes or no, 0 or 1. here we have a person is hiding heart disease or not.

Here we have libraries such as NumPy, pandas and for visualization, it is matplotlib and seaborn. For building the model we have used the sci-kit-learn library.
